# abstract: In this project, I investigated the causal impact of London's Low Traffic Neighbourhoods (LTNs) on road safety. Analyzing a decade of city-wide accident data, I used Python to employ an advanced Difference-in-Differences (DID) model to move beyond simple correlation. The analysis revealed a statistically significant and lasting 10% annual reduction in traffic crashes in areas with LTNs. These findings provide robust causal evidence that LTNs are an effective long-term strategy for improving urban safety, offering a critical data point for policymakers shaping future transport initiatives. 

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: Co-founded an award-winning non-profit to bridge the information gap in geospatial education. Spearheaded the creation of an open-access database covering 480+ GIS programmes globally and orchestrated a content strategy that grew a community of 180,000+ followers with 500k+ views. A synthesis of data management, educational equity, and digital growth.

## Overview

GISphere is a non-profit initiative founded in 2019 by a group of graduate students and scholars in Geographic Information Science/System (GIS) and related fields. We aim to facilitate the freedom of information in GIS education, enhance academic exchange and collaboration, and contribute to both academia and industry.

![GISphere Database Interface](homepage.png)

**GISphere Guide** is our flagship database, it features comprehensive information on **480 GIS-related academic programs and over 1,400 professors** from more than **96 countries**. All the information is open-sourced on GitHub and available on the official website gisphere.info in English and Chinese. Beyond the GISphere Guide, we offer a range of resources to support students and professionals in the GIS community:

**GISalon**: Engaging roundtable discussions providing insights into study abroad experiences and career development. Recordings are available on YouTube (in English) and Bilibili (in Chinese).

*Our video recording of online roundtable on Bilibili.*
![Global Brand Presence](LY.png)
*Through our international presence on LinkedIn and YouTube, we connect Chinese talent with the global geospatial industry and academia.*

**GISource**: A global news service delivering up-to-date information on admissions for GIS-related master’s and doctoral programs and postdoctoral opportunities at international institutions, avilable on gisphere.info, and delivered bi-weekly via WeChat newsletter.

**GISphere WeChat Account**: Sharing application experiences and study insights from students in GIS-related programs abroad, along with GISource newsletter, GIStory articles, and more.

**GISpace**: Vibrant community discussion groups on WeChat and WhatsApp for interaction among overseas scholars and students in GIS-related fields.

**GIS Education Research**: We are committed to advancing GIS education through research. Our published work includes:

* More research papers coming soon.
Beginning as a Chinese platform, GISphere launched its English version website in April 2022, expanding our reach to a global audience.

We have been supported by over 150 volunteers and benefited more than 5,000 students and teachers. We are continuously enhancing our platform to provide timely information on graduate school opportunities, academic positions, and other relevant resources in GIS and related fields. We believe in the power of community and open access to knowledge to foster a stronger global GIS community and empower GIS education for the future. Stay tuned for more updates and developments!
