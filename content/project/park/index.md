# abstract: For this project, I assumed the role of a GIS analyst tasked with identifying potential sites for a new solar park in Scotland. Using ArcGIS Pro, I developed a Multi-Criteria Evaluation (MCE) model to find the most suitable locations. The model integrated key factors like proximity to roads and built-up areas, low elevation, and south-facing slopes, while strictly excluding prime agricultural land. The final output was a comprehensive favorability map that clearly visualizes and ranks the most promising areas, providing a data-driven foundation for stakeholders to make informed decisions for future development. 

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: Performed a site suitability analysis in ArcGIS Pro to identify optimal locations for a new solar park in Scotland. I used Multi-Criteria Evaluation (MCE) and raster analysis to combine factors like elevation, aspect, soil type, and proximity to infrastructure. The project culminated in a favorability map that provides a data-driven recommendation for stakeholders.
