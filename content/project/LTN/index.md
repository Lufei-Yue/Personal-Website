# abstract: In this project, I investigated the causal impact of London's Low Traffic Neighbourhoods (LTNs) on road safety. Analyzing a decade of city-wide accident data, I used Python to employ an advanced Difference-in-Differences (DID) model to move beyond simple correlation. The analysis revealed a statistically significant and lasting 10% annual reduction in traffic crashes in areas with LTNs. These findings provide robust causal evidence that LTNs are an effective long-term strategy for improving urban safety, offering a critical data point for policymakers shaping future transport initiatives. 

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: Low Traffic Neighbourhoods (LTNs) are urban planning interventions aimed at reducing through traffic and improving road safety for pedestrians and cyclists. This study evaluates the effectiveness of LTNs in reducing traffic accidents in London using a Difference-in-Differences (DID) approach. The study analyzes annual traffic accident data from 2015 to mid 2024 and employs both a traditional DID model and an improved DID model to assess the short- and long-term effects of LTNs.

This work is my master dissertation. In this project, I investigated the causal impact of London's Low Traffic Neighbourhoods (LTNs) on road safety. Analyzing a decade of city-wide accident data, I used Python to employ an advanced Difference-in-Differences (DID) model to move beyond simple correlation. The analysis revealed a statistically significant and lasting 10% annual reduction in traffic crashes in areas with LTNs. These findings provide robust causal evidence that LTNs are an effective long-term strategy for improving urban safety, offering a critical data point for policymakers shaping future transport initiatives.
