# abstract: This project provides quantitative evidence that environmental inequality in London is not self-correcting; it worsened over the period studied. The findings suggest that broad, city-wide policies to reduce pollution may inadvertently benefit more affluent areas faster, thereby deepening social divides. This research underscores the critical need for targeted, justice-oriented environmental policies that prioritize air quality improvements in the most vulnerable and polluted communities first.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: Air pollution is a major public health risk, but is its burden shared equally across society? This project investigates the concept of environmental justice by assessing how the social distribution of air quality changed in London over a decade. The central question was - Did environmental inequality improve or worsen between 2001 and 2011?

This project investigated whether the burden of air pollution in London is shared equally across society, and how that distribution changed between 2001 and 2011. By integrating air quality data (NO2 and PM10) with social deprivation indices in a GIS environment, I analyzed the population-weighted pollution exposure for different community groups. The goal was to provide quantitative evidence on the state of environmental justice in the city.

My analysis revealed a persistent and worsening inequality. In both years, the most deprived communities were exposed to significantly higher levels of pollution. Critically, while city-wide air quality improved, the benefits were not shared equally. The least deprived areas saw a 29.6% reduction in NO2 pollution, nearly double the 16% reduction experienced in the most deprived areas.

This widening gap demonstrates that broad environmental policies can inadvertently deepen social inequity. The project concludes that a "one-size-fits-all" approach is insufficient. To achieve true environmental justice, policies must be specifically targeted to prioritize air quality improvements in the most vulnerable and historically overburdened communities.
