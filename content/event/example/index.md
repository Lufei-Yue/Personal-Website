# abstract: Standard 3D models created from UAV (drone) imagery are excellent for capturing large areas quickly, but they often suffer from significant limitations at ground level. Textures on building facades can be blurry, and complex structures like covered walkways or overhangs are often distorted or incomplete. This project aimed to solve this common industry problem by developing a method to enhance model accuracy and detail.

This project addressed a common challenge in 3D modeling where models generated solely from UAV (drone) data lack sufficient ground-level detail and texture clarity. My goal was to develop a cost-effective method to fuse aerial imagery with high-resolution, ground-based smartphone images to produce a single, high-fidelity 3D model of the Tianjin Normal University Library.

My methodology centered on unifying the two disparate datasets within a single coordinate system. I first created a detailed local model from the smartphone images, then used common tie points to perform an absolute orientation and similarity transformation on the UAV dataset. This precisely aligned the large-scale aerial model with the detailed ground model. By merging the two aligned datasets in ContextCapture, I was able to generate a final, integrated model.

The results were a significant success. The fused model exhibited crisp, clear textures and complete, accurate geometry for complex ground-level features like walkways and building entrancesâ€”details that were previously distorted or blurry. This project demonstrates a practical and scalable workflow for creating more realistic and accurate digital twins for urban planning and architectural visualization without relying on expensive, specialized equipment.
