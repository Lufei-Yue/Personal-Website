# abstract: The Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) provides a comprehensive measure of deprivation across different regions in the UK. While the specific methodologies vary slightly between countries, IMD generally accounts for factors such as income, employment, education, health, crime, housing access, and environmental quality. This project focuses on London, exploring the relationship between IMD and education levels to better understand how deprivation may impact educational attainment across the city.
